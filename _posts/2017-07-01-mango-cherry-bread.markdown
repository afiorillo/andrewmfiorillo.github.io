It's mango season and I was recently inundated with 20+ mangoes from a friend.
I decided to put together something like a banana bread, but using mangoes and some other flavors in place of the bananas.
This has the double benefit of being both delicious and <em>not</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_equivalent_dose">radioactive</a>

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>
The ingredients get portioned and mixed into three groups: Dry, Wet, and Fruit.

{:.ingredient-table}
| Group | Ingredient          | Quantity | Mass (g) |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Dry   | All-Purpose Flour   | 2 cups   | 290      |
| Dry   | Baking Soda         | 2 tsp.   | 6        |
| Dry   | Sea Salt            | 0.5 tsp. | 3        |
| Dry   | Speculaas Spice     | 1 tbsp.  | 6        |
| Dry   | Corticated Cardamom | 0.5 tsp. | --       |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Wet   | Plain Greek Yogurt  | 0.5 cup  | 132      |
| Wet   | Half & Half         | 0.25 cup | 54       |
| Wet   | White Sugar         | 0.5 cup  | 108      |
| Wet   | Light Brown Sugar   | 0.75 cup | 154      |
| Wet   | Vanilla Extract     | 1 tsp    | --       |
| Wet   | Eggs                | 3 whole  | 145      |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Fruit | Mango, peeled and diced | 2 fruits | 450  |
| Fruit | Dried Cherries      | --       | 53       |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Total Yield   |             |          | 1.4 kg   |

<strong>Equipment:</strong>
Three bowls (one for each group), silicone spatula, two 9"x5" loaf pans (greased and <a href="#">dusted</a>), and an oven set to 350 â„‰.


<strong>Procedure:</strong>
The ingredients are mixed together like most cakes: wet into dry, then fruit into mix.
The acid from the yogurt will start reacting with the baking soda immediately, so once the wet and dry are mixed it's best to work quickly until the pans are filled.

<ol>
  <li>Prep and mix each of the ingredient groups separately.</li>
  <li>Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Leaving clumps is alright, though you'll want to mix at least until all of the flour has been saturated.</li>
  <li>Fold the fruits into the batter mixture.</li>
  <li>Portion the mixture equally into the two loaf pans.</li>
  <li>Let the loaves rest for 10-20 minutes before baking.</li>
  <li>Bake the loaves for 50-60 minutes overall, rotating in the oven about halfway through.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Next time, I would puree about half of the mango and mix it in with the wets (probably removing the Half & Half). The texture of the mango is nice, but the quantity reminds me of fruit cake. The chunks would probably be better placed as a layer than mixed throughout.</li>
  <li>This recipe is loosely derived from SACKPAC's <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/22516/magic-mango-bread/">Magic Mango Bread</a></li>
  <li>This could probably do well with an icing, though if it were iced I would definitely reduce the sugar content.</li>
</ul>
