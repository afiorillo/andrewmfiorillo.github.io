DeepZoom is not new.
Compared to some of the web's newer layers, a standard from 2007 is ancient.
Still, modern(ish) tools like (Leaflet)[#] and (OpenSeaDragon)[#] depend on it.
I know of applications in GIS and digital microscopy, and I'm certain there are more.

At its core, it is a way of representing *very* large images without having *very* much memory.
In the most naive implementation, this is done by breaking a *very* large image into many small images (i.e. "tiles").
To speed up loading lower-resolution representations, multiple "levels" are generated -- each a downsampled version of its predecessor.
The Microsoft DeepZoom standard does this, and also enforces a `.dzi` file to specify metadata.
